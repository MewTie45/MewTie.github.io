<h2 class="Rulez">
<ul class="WordRulez">To make everyone's drive-in experience enjoyable, we ask that you abide by the following :</ul>
    <ol>
        <li>All Trucks, Vans, SUV's and large vehicles must park next to the yellow speaker poles.</li>

        <li>Pets permitted provided they are on a leash and cleaned up after.</li>

        <li>Rainchecks are only issued for loss of power.</li>

        <li>Take only one parking space. Place your chairs, blankets, etc. in front of your vehicle.</li>

        <li>Keep rear hatches at a level so that they don't obstruct the view of those behind you. We will provide string to tie them down.</li>

        <li>Please use your parking lights while entering and exiting the drive-in.</li>

        <li>Please remember to keep your foot off the brake pedal. Brake lights disturb the people behind you.</li>

        <li>For children's safety, please don't let them run unattended especially as the movies let out and cars are exiting.</li>

        <li>Be considerate of those around you - don't be loud or disruptive.</li>

        <li>Please use the red trash cans located throughout the drive-in to discard your trash.</li>
    </ol>
